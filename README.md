# assignment
Two tasks are completed
1. Single activity: Have an ImageView which the user can drag around the screen. The updated positions of the imageView should be constantly logged to the console using Log.d() as the user moves it around.
3. Single activity: Have a bunch of views (random text, images etc. - anything you want) and a button. If user clicks the button, the screen should be covered with a transparent textview saying "Hello world" and all the underlying elements should be blurry.
You can use - https://github.com/wasabeef/Blurry this library.
